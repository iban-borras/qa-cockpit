# Changelog

## 0.1.0 (unreleased)

The first version outside CritKeep: what CritKeep's functional tests used
every day, generalised behind one config file.

- The CLI: the stack (`up`, `down`, `purge`, `status`, `reset`), suites
  (`suites`, `setup`, `sessions`, `decide`, `replay`, `stamp`, `hash`,
  `pass`), `open`, `mcp`, `doctor`, `lock` / `unlock`, `init`, and commands
  of the project's own.
- The cockpit: the table of people and its timeline, live screens, the
  inspector (photos, clicks, requests), traces, the run report, runs from
  any terminal followed live, the lock in the header; English, Catalan and
  Spanish.
- `composeStack` and `processStack` for the two usual ways an app starts.
- `--in-docker` for a compose stack.
- `init`: a project folder with a commented config, fixtures, the suites'
  guide, an example suite and setup, the agents' skill and a section in
  `AGENTS.md`.
- An example project: a two-person chat with its suite, setup and recording.
